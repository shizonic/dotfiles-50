This is another GTK-style-based theme. But instead of using the pixmaps
and colours from the GTK style to define the frame, just use the
background colours to tint a set of pre-drawn images.
Some of the images originally came from screenshots on the GNOME UI
hit-squad web page, which I think uses the `GTK' Enlightenment theme.
