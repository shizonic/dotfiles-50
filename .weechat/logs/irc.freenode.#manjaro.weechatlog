2017-07-25 00:53:02	physkets	of XMPP?
2017-07-25 00:53:31	Zergling_man	Yeah.
2017-07-25 00:54:16	physkets	:) I find it interesting too... It affords the possiblity of expanding possibilities to include video chat,
2017-07-25 00:54:35	physkets	and also, if people VPN into the network,
2017-07-25 00:55:05	physkets	it can be used even when not physically inside, for video chats

2017-07-25 00:58:24	physkets	:D
2017-07-25 00:58:47	Zergling_man	(Or better: With ftp.)
2017-07-25 00:58:48	physkets	ah, IRC... well, no, this isn't for public rooms...
2017-07-25 00:58:59	physkets	he he ha ha...
2017-07-25 00:59:25	physkets	oh I forgot to mention, the solution should have multi-platform clients available..
2017-07-25 00:59:51	physkets	people primarily on linuxes, but quite a few on windows and mac
2017-07-25 01:00:18	Zergling_man	I know more about clients than I do about servers (which isn't hard given how little that is); Pidgin/libpurple will probably be a sufficient answer regardless of what server you go with...
2017-07-25 01:00:56	physkets	yes, I know XMPP has all kinds of clients. I mean't for solutions other than XMPP.
2017-07-25 01:01:33	Zergling_man	And I meant "suggest a server solution that Pidgin can't connect to".

2017-07-25 03:22:23	reza96	hi. I have a problem to run an app in manjaro. can you help me?
2017-07-25 03:23:04	rakya77	which one?
2017-07-25 03:23:48	reza96	yaourt -S persepolis
2017-07-25 03:24:27	reza96	I installed this app but when i run it in terminal
2017-07-25 03:25:07	rakya77	yes?
2017-07-25 03:25:17	reza96	this error : https://thepasteb.in/p/Z4hPBvGXJ2XtG

2017-07-25 03:26:22	+peetaur2	MacOSHighSierraE?
2017-07-25 03:26:26	rakya77	have you tried persepolis-git? meanwhile I'll look it up...
2017-07-25 03:26:54	+peetaur2	I would say the QtCore.so file is broken, not persepolis
2017-07-25 03:27:05	+peetaur2	allt hat line says is "from PyQt5 import QtCore"
2017-07-25 03:27:46	+peetaur2	make your own python file with the same and see what it does https://bpaste.net/show/52e986aa27cd
2017-07-25 03:28:41	reza96	thanks wait to test it
2017-07-25 03:29:49	+peetaur2	to fix it, maybe   pacman -Qo /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/PyQt5/QtCore.so  to see if it's a pacman package...if so, reinstall it. And if not, then use pip to remove it, verify it's really gone (ls //usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/PyQt5/QtCore*) and install it again.
2017-07-25 03:30:10	+peetaur2	and if it's a pacman package, you can still remove with pacman and install again with pip, to get a possibly different version

2017-07-25 04:32:29	+peetaur2	if the -rt is the problem, then find would show it (in the wrong dir, eg. /lib/modules/4.11.9-1-MANJARO instead of 4.11.9-1-rt7-MANJARO), just modprobe will fail

2017-07-25 04:38:04	Newbie2	I remove anything and start from beginning.
2017-07-25 04:38:36	Zergling_man	My guess is linux-rt-virtualbox-host-modules. But I'm not offered an rt-4.11 kernel, so I'm not so sure.

2017-07-25 04:40:43	+peetaur2	don't use ls...use find
2017-07-25 04:40:47	Newbie2	2folders exists → /lib/modules/4.11.11-1-MANJARO: and /lib/modules/4.11.9-1-rt7-MANJARO: → none have a vboxsvr in it
2017-07-25 04:41:22	BraveSirRobin	the linux-rt-manjaro kernel is 4.11 so as far as i can see Zergling_man suggestion should work
2017-07-25 04:41:59	+peetaur2	nothing matters if you still don't even have a module installed for the wrong version... so let's figure out why that doesn't work first
2017-07-25 04:42:01	Zergling_man	That's odd, my Manjaro Settings Manager says rt is 4.9.
2017-07-25 04:42:16	BraveSirRobin	there is rt and rt-lts
2017-07-25 04:42:51	Zergling_man	Yes, and mine says they're both 4.9.

2017-07-25 04:43:07	BraveSirRobin	rt-lts is on 4.9 rt 4.11.9_rt7-1 it says for me so i would guess the correct host modules to install is linux-rt-manjaro-virtualbox-host-modules
2017-07-25 04:43:09	Zergling_man	Wait no, sorry, it says lts is 4.6.

2017-07-25 04:44:46	+peetaur2	this doesn't look at a specific kernel

2017-07-25 04:46:23	+peetaur2	ok so then we can assume what you wrote before my first find command was wrong, "but modprobe vboxsvr"  should have been vboxdrv or another of those listed

2017-07-25 04:55:42	nimatel	question .. i bet rakya77 will know .. if you DD something like a hard drive that is a 250gig capacity and if full of stuff for 90gigs... is the DD image you made 90gigs or 250? thanks

2017-07-25 04:56:45	aldcor	hi! i want to use proxy with google chrome but it doesn't seem to react at all when i use proxy settings manually
2017-07-25 04:57:04	+peetaur2	I never thought software should be needed...there are lots of things you can do that require reading, like many games
2017-07-25 04:57:30	+peetaur2	one thing I noticed at school was everyone else sucked at things like that and also map reading, but I was great probably from games :)
2017-07-25 04:57:46	nimatel	thanks rakya77 
2017-07-25 04:59:04	Zergling_man	Personally, I just went to the school's library.
2017-07-25 04:59:18	Zergling_man	But still, why not do it with computers?
2017-07-25 04:59:24	aldcor	oh, i just needed to restart a browser :)
2017-07-25 04:59:30	inahd	peetaur2, i like the way you think. i also do not particularly favor the software approach, but it has come up
2017-07-25 04:59:59	+peetaur2	and also my parents bought us these things https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_(toy)

2017-07-26 22:18:57	Aph3x-WL	it can slow down the system so a lot of people just disable it
2017-07-26 22:21:01	Aph3x-WL	you could always disable it and see if performance improves and enable it again if you want it

2017-07-26 22:54:10	AJSlye	if baloo is on and you use krunner (alt+F2) or type in menu's then files are shown as well as apps
2017-07-26 22:54:34	AJSlye	If not then it can only search apps.
2017-07-26 22:55:04	AJSlye	so say you forgot the name of a file you were working on, but remember some of the content.
2017-07-26 22:55:50	AJSlye	with baloo on you can type in your menu, desktop, or in krunner directly some of the files content and it will list files containing matching contenent

2017-07-26 22:58:38	AJSlye	I have mount points set up in samba-mounter and with fish that I tend to add to my baloo index

Lillith was the first female, made of the earth as was Adam, and thus she refused to be subservient to him and was cast out from the garden of eden, and then Eve was made from Adam's rib, so shewas made of

2017-07-26 23:56:24	+negen	or if when they did kill the innocent they would be imprissioned like they should 
2017-07-26 23:56:58	AJSlye	negen: Stop blaming the police for every issues. I'm not saying it never happens, I'm saying not all or even a majority of police officers are like that.
2017-07-26 23:57:24	AJSlye	but people blame the oficer rather than the criminal or the criminal act.
2017-07-26 23:57:59	+negen	for example the latest news headlines about the girl from OZ (white) killed by a black officer all current signs point to him getting fired and probably going to jail 
2017-07-26 23:58:00	batch	police is the most bad job in the world
2017-07-26 23:58:10	AJSlye	plain and simple, pull a gun on a cop expect to be shot. Run and expect to be tackled, punch expect to get punched back.
2017-07-26 23:58:19	Stuzz	I blame the US culture as a whole.  Killing someone always seems to be one of the first viable options to any and all problems.
2017-07-26 23:58:38	AJSlye	Stuzz: NO, it's not..
2017-07-26 23:58:49	+negen	where as the recent shootings that one black dude who had a conceled carry and was reaching for his wallet gets shot and the police got away with it 
2017-07-26 23:59:05	AJSlye	Killing someone trying to kill you or others then yes.
2017-07-26 23:59:16	+negen	I am not talking about the poeple getting killed running from the cops

2017-07-26 23:59:22	+negen	or anything like that 
2017-07-26 23:59:43	Stuzz	AJSlye: Right..  So someone trying to kill you or another was one of the first viable options for that person.
2017-07-27 00:00:13	+negen	cops have many non-leathal ways to stop people if need be 
2017-07-27 00:00:42	+negen	shooting people who call the police to report rapes or shooting people in parked cars is not anything that puts the cops lifes in danger 
2017-07-27 00:00:54	AJSlye	negen: and most use those first.
2017-07-27 00:01:05	+negen	not in the USA 
2017-07-27 00:01:15	Stuzz	Sure.  Just seems to me (as someone who doesn't follow too close) that non-lethal isn't as high up the priority list as it should be
2017-07-27 00:01:18	+negen	maybe in Canada or germany or russia

2017-07-27 00:01:56	+negen	but in USA most the police invovled shootings happen within the first minute or two of the intial police contact with the suspect
2017-07-27 00:02:05	AJSlye	negen: Yes, and there was a white woman killed by a cop after she called them about a domestic disturbance coming from behind her yard.
2017-07-27 00:02:11	AJSlye	Where is the outrage there
2017-07-27 00:02:22	AJSlye	where is the mainstream media on that one
2017-07-27 00:02:25	AJSlye	huh
2017-07-27 00:02:33	batch	police just means license to kill right
2017-07-27 00:02:41	Stuzz	AJSlye: In australia I suppose
2017-07-27 00:02:48	+negen	well cnn is all on that one and they did protest and caused the chief of police to quit 
2017-07-27 00:02:49	Stuzz	I've heard about that one plenty
2017-07-27 00:03:08	batch	that one chief
2017-07-27 00:03:17	Aph3x-WL	the cops in the US are taught that they're "fighting a war out there" instead of being taught to keep the piece so they're ready to shoot, that's the problem
2017-07-27 00:03:29	Aph3x-WL	peace*
2017-07-27 00:03:34	Aph3x-WL	i can't believe i did that
2017-07-27 00:03:45	batch	Aph3x-WL i feel you
2017-07-27 00:03:48	AJSlye	negen: Oh, and what about the black officer shot by some asshole as she sat in here unit?
2017-07-27 00:04:03	Stuzz	Right...  so, the culture of the whole thing stinks.
2017-07-27 00:04:26	batch	political shit
2017-07-27 00:04:32	batch	i dissagree with the concept
2017-07-27 00:04:33	batch	xD
2017-07-27 00:04:39	+negen	solution would be get rid of police and create a spartan hole 
2017-07-27 00:04:45	AJSlye	do you think it was ok for the state governor to go to a protest over seas the day before the officers funeral 
2017-07-27 00:04:48	batch	anarchy
2017-07-27 00:05:00	+negen	every one left to defend them selves 
2017-07-27 00:05:06	batch	yeah man
2017-07-27 00:05:11	batch	just behave :p

2017-07-27 00:05:54	+negen	yeah kinda shitty being born in america

2017-07-27 00:07:00	AJSlye	must be a left wing socialist..
2017-07-27 00:07:02	Aph3x-WL	the police don't stop gangs or terrorists lol
2017-07-27 00:07:09	+negen	police do not stop gangs or terrorists 
2017-07-27 00:07:26	+negen	police fund gangs and arm terrorists 
2017-07-27 00:07:30	Stuzz	Most of the time folks want to start something to put themselves into a position to defend themselves
2017-07-27 00:08:28	AJSlye	negen: Yea, you keep telling yourself that. Do you need some crayons and a safe place?
2017-07-27 00:08:29	AJSlye	negen: NO governments do..
2017-07-27 00:08:29	+negen	for example my family is mainly in the public school bussiness teachers,directors and what not kinda a family thing i guess 
2017-07-27 00:08:29	AJSlye	AKA POLITICIANS, not police.
2017-07-27 00:08:52	AJSlye	negen: Yep, left wing socialists
2017-07-27 00:08:57	+negen	well teachers here are affaid to legally by arms because they think there is a possiblity of national registered arms database that may come to effect 
2017-07-27 00:09:19	+negen	so they illegally buy arms from the local police 
2017-07-27 00:09:35	Stuzz	More guns, more safe
2017-07-27 00:09:39	AJSlye	negen: That would only happen if the democrats get their way.
2017-07-27 00:10:20	+negen	and when I was a youth and sold marjuana mostly we bought it from the local police

2017-07-27 00:11:20	Stuzz	How much safer is Texas compared to say California?
2017-07-27 00:11:23	+negen	here they would not call it liberal 
2017-07-27 00:11:46	AJSlye	Stuzz: Everyone has a gun, try to hold up a bank in that atmosphere.
2017-07-27 00:12:10	AJSlye	negen: Liberals ususaly don't
2017-07-27 00:12:10	+negen	in california mostly the real gangs are controlled either by polititions or mexican cartels 
2017-07-27 00:12:27	AJSlye	negen: Now that I would agree with.
2017-07-27 00:12:41	+negen	so generally the gang crimes are somewhat controlled 
2017-07-27 00:13:03	AJSlye	and why per capa hasmost of the sancuary cities, hmm wonder why..
2017-07-27 00:13:56	+negen	it is interesting when you walk through the streets of okland or LA at night and can see how every crime right there in plain sight seems controlled to the point it is almost like a movie

2017-07-29 00:27:31	NolanSyKinsley	I am on a new install and my hyper x cloud 2 USB headphones are really quiet, even with all volume turned to max. I just did a reinstall from my last manjaro install that did not have this issue, any guidance?
2017-07-29 00:28:10	NolanSyKinsley	Nvmd... that is odd...
2017-07-29 00:28:42	NolanSyKinsley	Volume was turned down on the analog sterio profile, but when set to the digital duplex stereo the previous settings were still being applied.

2017-07-29 00:37:16	NolanSyKinsley	peetaur, it is about the feeling, not the concept of "in the cloud". Which I must say, these headphones are really great, with the soft covers they do become almost unnoticable when gaming

2017-07-29 09:06:44	rakya77	I don't know how to do it in linux but if you have access to a working windows machine use rufus to make bootable and don't forget to select MBR only
2017-07-29 09:07:27	maggo	I have a bootable win10 usb (I used unetbootin)

2017-07-29 09:10:06	rakya77	I know.
2017-07-29 09:10:33	rakya77	for a fact, that you need to make a MBR/BIOS bootable USB
2017-07-29 09:11:06	maggo	ok ill give that a shot
2017-07-29 09:11:07	rakya77	but, I don't got a clue if you can do it in linux

2017-07-29 17:40:10	Kjeldmis	however, if you check the deepin forums you will notice that the issue is older. Maybe about a year or so. 
2017-07-29 17:40:11	manjaroDeepin	so it's going to be fixt in near future i think?
2017-07-29 17:40:18	manjaroDeepin	oh
2017-07-29 17:41:21	Rainox	Does anyone know if this is the best way to dual boot windows and manjaro?  I've read a lot online where people were having issues with windows 10's boot loader taking over.  http://linuxbsdos.com/2016/11/07/how-to-dual-boot-manjaro-16-10-windows-10-on-a-computer-with-uefi-firmware/

2017-07-29 17:41:30	manjaroDeepin	qnd what desktop your're on?
2017-07-29 17:41:50	Kjeldmis	I dont know. Deepin developers are amateurs - sorry to be harsh, but the issues in the DE is rarely fixed. They had a serious memory leak for years before they fixed it. 
2017-07-29 17:42:46	manjaroDeepin	pity i like deepin
2017-07-29 17:42:49	Kjeldmis	Rainox: use UEFI for it.
2017-07-29 17:43:06	Kjeldmis	so do I. Its pretty and intuitive. 
2017-07-29 17:45:11	Rainox	Kjeldmis: Is that an option in bios?
2017-07-29 17:46:03	Kjeldmis	Rainox: Well, you usually got two choices. Using legacy boot with MBR or use UEFI. 
2017-07-29 17:46:19	Kjeldmis	If the system is new enough, you will UEFI as a choice. 
2017-07-29 17:46:27	Kjeldmis	Or as default. 
2017-07-29 17:47:01	Rainox	its less than 2 years old

2017-07-29 17:48:38	Kjeldmis	Its pretty simple. With UEFI the underlying bootloader is located on the mainboard. It simply reads from a special partition on your harddrive, which contains the bootloader for the systems you install.

2017-08-02 05:51:14	+peetaur2	the thing is that openrc is so much like sysv that you don't have to learn much... like instead of chkconfig/update-rc.d/whatever junk your distro had, you rc-update add, and the rest is basically the same (plus more that didn't exist in sysv that is optional)
2017-08-02 05:51:44	+peetaur2	all the workaround I had to do to make systemd work though....such pain. Like try mounting bcache on boot and it not only fails to boot, even with nofail option set, but it even fails to enter emergency mode
2017-08-02 05:52:19	+peetaur2	or on ubuntu where randomly the text ttys will let you in without a login ... wtf is this  http://brockmann-consult.de/peter2/2014-11-21%20Ubuntu%2014.04%20login%20mixed%20with%20rescue%20shell.png   root access without login?

2017-08-02 06:03:46	+peetaur2	switching manjaro systemd to openrc is pretty simple, but I think the docs are out of date regarding xdm...just install sddm and the rest was intuitive for me (but I'm using plasma5)  https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=OpenRC,_an_alternative_to_systemd#Installation
2017-08-02 06:04:06	+peetaur2	and for switching arch to openrc, I linked it before  http://systemd-free.org/migrate.php   but haven't tested it myself
2017-08-02 06:04:18	+peetaur2	but the best is to just use the openrc installer and not have systemd at all...works perfectly

2017-08-02 06:09:14	MiLeon	my try to change my system to openrc was failed
2017-08-02 06:09:26	MiLeon	the most software is for systemd
2017-08-02 06:09:40	rattrat	Mileon: not exactly
2017-08-02 06:09:45	+peetaur2	the software is not *for* systemd...just the distro default is systemd, so they are missing some init scripts
2017-08-02 06:09:48	rattrat	all of my softwares are running fine here
2017-08-02 06:09:57	+peetaur2	init scripts in openrc are trivial to write...you could even generate them from the systemd stuff
2017-08-02 06:10:00	rattrat	You just need to configure the init scripts
2017-08-02 06:10:27	MiLeon	hmm
2017-08-02 06:10:33	MiLeon	i would openrc
2017-08-02 06:11:18	rattrat	peetaur2: Yeah It'll become an pure arch-based distro now
2017-08-02 06:12:00	+peetaur2	so it'll crash all the time like arch (except for the systemd crashes which are probably the majority still :P)?
2017-08-02 06:12:13	rattrat	peetaur2: Nahh
2017-08-02 06:12:19	rattrat	mine's running fine here

2017-08-02 08:59:07	Jolt2bolt	ahhh
2017-08-02 08:59:24	no_references	lsb_release -rd should show the version number
2017-08-02 08:59:36	Jolt2bolt	just do uname -a

2017-08-02 09:00:51	morsus	Also I got some questions about environment of Manjaro. When I open eg. 3 tabs in FireFox and I minimise it, when I try to get it back up (by clicking the task on the taskbar at the bottom) it shows me those 3 tabs instead of popping the FireFox back in full screen, Is there a way to change this?

2017-08-02 09:01:00	Jolt2bolt	NestorJ, better use uname -a that give you the version you have installed

2017-08-02 09:01:53	MiLeon	okay
2017-08-02 09:02:06	Jolt2bolt	I mean if it is 32 bit it should say x86 and if it's 64 bits it should say x86_64
2017-08-02 09:02:07	Jolt2bolt	XDD
2017-08-02 09:02:35	no_references	that's a different meaning of version

2017-08-02 09:03:24	banavara	I have asked this before when there was not many people, so asking again
2017-08-02 09:03:29	banavara	hi on Manjaro XFCE, when screen is locked, it locks twice
2017-08-02 09:03:29	banavara	ie, once unlocked, it again gets locked immediately and have to unlock it again
2017-08-02 09:03:29	banavara	how to get this resolved
2017-08-02 09:03:38	Jolt2bolt	no_references, well he was asking what version of manjaro he has installed because you can install 32 bits intallation in 64 bits processor!:P
2017-08-02 09:04:12	NestorJ	It's appear this when I use uname -a: "Linux nestorJG-pc 4.9.39-1-MANJARO #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Jul 21 10:37:40 UTC 2017 i686 GNU/Linux"
2017-08-02 09:04:21	Jolt2bolt	banavara, change you locker to i3locker because the XFCE locker is bugged since... I know...
2017-08-02 09:04:22	Jolt2bolt	XDD
2017-08-02 09:04:29	no_references	but Manjaro version could also be 17.02 which is the version of manjaro, but not bit type
2017-08-02 09:04:37	no_references	nvm lol
2017-08-02 09:04:39	Jolt2bolt	NestorJ, that mean you're using a 32 bits version

2017-08-02 09:05:41	NestorJ	Do I have to reinstall Majaro's Linux again?
2017-08-02 09:05:42	Jolt2bolt	downloading and installing the 64 bit version is the easiest path
2017-08-02 09:05:56	+peetaur2	NestorJ: other than reinstall? maybe install a 64 bit kernel and boot into that, then replace all the userland stuff while running the 64 bit kernel
2017-08-02 09:06:17	Jolt2bolt	well you can change to 64 bits without intalling but it's a long and time consuming path
2017-08-02 09:06:18	+peetaur2	for fun, but not for time saving, since surely it'll fail and eat all your time until it works
2017-08-02 09:06:19	NestorJ	Ok. I execute Steam and it says to me that only plays on Linux 64 bits
2017-08-02 09:07:47	Jolt2bolt	peetaur2, well he might need to change to manjaro x86_64 repos, do a pacman -Syyu and activate multilib too!:P

2017-08-02 12:54:04	ringo	ajslye,  changing xorg is not by mhwd ?

2017-08-02 12:54:37	morsus	can i use mhwd to remove drivers?
2017-08-02 12:54:43	ajslye	it will change the drivers for you.
2017-08-02 12:54:54	ringo	no use if catalyst interacts ?
2017-08-02 12:55:17	ringo	personally its a pain in the ass to do there is no proper documentation about it
2017-08-02 12:55:27	morsus	is there a way to list all installed drivers?
2017-08-02 12:55:34	ajslye	mhwd-gpu lets you tell xorg to use mesa after catalyst is removed with mhwd..
2017-08-02 12:55:53	ringo	but you must change catalyst-server

2017-08-02 12:58:34	ajslye	if you still have an old install then /etc/X11/mhwd.d might still be there but should be empty

2017-08-02 13:00:53	Soo_Slow	its okay, if your 1st linux installation isnt perfect, actually. I've spent almost week, when I've used to migrate from windows for 1st time, in order to make everything work, coz my knowledge werent good enough and I did lots of mistakes. But now I use manjaro for like 1.5 years and everything works good
2017-08-02 13:01:10	morsus	i used Mint before
2017-08-02 13:01:13	morsus	for about 6 months
2017-08-02 13:01:26	morsus	still Manjaro is totally different
2017-08-02 13:01:38	morsus	so you suggest a clean install?
2017-08-02 13:01:43	Soo_Slow	aaah, misunderstood you then
2017-08-02 13:01:50	ringo	would better a clean one
2017-08-02 13:02:01	morsus	damn I just set up my conky xD
2017-08-02 13:02:03	ringo	atleast lesser time conuming
2017-08-02 13:02:15	Soo_Slow	just copy your config to usb drive or somewere else
2017-08-02 13:02:17	ringo	my first manjaro install i did 3times
2017-08-02 13:02:18	ajslye	a gree a clean install is best if you messed it up somehow.
2017-08-02 13:02:34	Soo_Slow	and then paste to new setup
2017-08-02 13:02:39	morsus	meh I was kidding

2017-08-02 13:11:10	ajslye	why do you have more than one installed
2017-08-02 13:11:16	morsus	no idea
2017-08-02 13:11:22	morsus	i remember updating them
2017-08-02 13:11:33	ajslye	where are you seeing this?
2017-08-02 13:11:40	morsus	it just got removed xD
2017-08-02 13:12:03	morsus	but while installing the nonfree drivers
2017-08-02 13:12:09	morsus	i got to choose
2017-08-02 13:12:18	morsus	for what kernel should i install
2017-08-02 13:12:24	morsus	maybe that is where i made a mistake
2017-08-02 13:12:33	ajslye	pacman can only update within one series aka 4.12.1, 4.12.2, etc.
2017-08-02 13:13:05	ajslye	you have to use mhwd-kernel to install or remove each kernel series.
2017-08-02 13:13:15	ajslye	which kernel did you wish to use?
2017-08-02 13:13:41	morsus	hmm I have no idea,isnt the newer one the better one?
2017-08-02 13:13:50	ajslye	I would remove the others either from the cli or using the mhwd-kernel gui.
2017-08-02 13:14:06	ajslye	<morsus> not always
2017-08-02 13:14:22	morsus	The following kernels are installed in your system:
2017-08-02 13:14:22	morsus	   * linux412
2017-08-02 13:14:22	morsus	   * linux49
2017-08-02 13:14:31	ajslye	regressions can happen from time to time.
2017-08-02 13:14:37	morsus	so 412 is actually 4.12
2017-08-02 13:14:41	ajslye	right
2017-08-02 13:14:45	morsus	and 49 is 4.9?
2017-08-02 13:16:04	ajslye	yep, it think you get it
2017-08-02 13:16:04	morsus	so 412 should be better xD
2017-08-02 13:16:04	ajslye	probably, but 4.9 is the LTS
2017-08-02 13:16:04	morsus	LTS?
2017-08-02 13:16:04	ajslye	so I would leave bith
2017-08-02 13:16:04	morsus	i assume more stable

2017-08-02 13:16:04	ajslye	4.4 and 4.9 are LTS kernels
2017-08-02 13:16:04	morsus	oh so more help
2017-08-02 13:16:05	morsus	so i should stick to 4.9?
2017-08-02 13:16:09	ajslye	Well, it means the kernel.org team maintain them longer.

2017-08-02 13:18:18	Soo_Slow	best kernel atm
2017-08-02 13:18:21	Soo_Slow	most stable
2017-08-02 13:18:29	ajslye	gives more time for developement on new features etc, in the other series to settle down before there is an update.
2017-08-02 13:18:42	morsus	damn,412 is my current kernel

2017-08-02 13:39:18	morsus	ajslye, i got about 170 updates ready, are among them the kernel updates? should I even let all updates go?

2017-08-02 13:39:33	Tyresc	err going with task manager then
2017-08-02 13:40:23	ajslye	<morsus> the kernel can only update within the same series. aka 4.9.7 to 4.9.8 it will never go from 4.9 to 4.10, etc.

2017-08-02 15:50:35	zamk	i don't know if it still is
2017-08-02 15:50:46	zamk	it was a pain to install
2017-08-02 15:50:51	bonehead	lol
2017-08-02 15:51:37	bonehead	pretty much down to personal preferences..
2017-08-02 15:51:38	ajslye	<zamk> Manjaro is def not Arch..
2017-08-02 15:51:42	zamk	personally i choose distros based on how they look
2017-08-02 15:51:47	zamk	:)
2017-08-02 15:51:58	ajslye	based on, derived from, fork there of, yes. and arch distro it is not.

2017-08-02 15:52:46	ajslye	kinda partially all three of those actually.
2017-08-02 15:52:58	zamk	yes but i don't want to spend the time to modify it 
2017-08-02 15:53:06	zamk	i want it looking good out of the box
2017-08-02 15:53:10	bonehead	zamk, :)
2017-08-02 15:53:21	zamk	i spend enough time tweaking nvidia drivers
2017-08-02 15:53:28	bonehead	hehe
2017-08-02 15:53:43	bonehead	pretty straight forward in manjaro atleast
2017-08-02 15:53:50	ajslye	<bonehead> Like I did, take manjaro net edition install, remove network manager and add connman, add my repo and install Enlightenment from my personal server.
2017-08-02 15:54:17	bonehead	ajslye, :) the freedom...

2017-08-02 15:56:53	bonehead	back in 5....
2017-08-02 15:56:56	ajslye	<zamk> that is why we have three officially suported desktops and many community supported editions.
2017-08-02 15:57:07	ajslye	best of both worlds I think..
2017-08-02 15:57:11	zamk	if they are gonna risk breaking their computer while installing any linux distro it should be worth it
2017-08-02 15:57:18	ajslye	pick you favorite and install it.
2017-08-02 15:57:36	zamk	do you have plans to ship computers with manjaro?
2017-08-02 15:57:49	zamk	like dells with ubuntu?
2017-08-02 15:58:04	ajslye	albiet the official version have finnaly tamed themselves down, they no longer come preloaded down with too many extras, etc.
2017-08-02 15:58:45	ajslye	<zamk> there is a reason OEM like me use Ubuntu for end users.
2017-08-02 15:59:00	ajslye	it's called OEM install mode..
2017-08-02 15:59:52	ajslye	it's in the syslinux options menu's
2017-08-02 16:00:05	zamk	hmm
2017-08-02 16:00:09	zamk	i didn't know that
2017-08-02 16:00:24	zamk	is it something that other distros cannot use?
2017-08-02 16:01:04	ajslye	<zamk> it's part of ubiquity..
2017-08-02 16:01:21	ajslye	so no not really, only ubuntu derivitives AFAIK..
2017-08-02 16:01:41	ajslye	unless your a developer, I'm sure it probably could be odapted.

2017-08-02 23:30:27	manjaro-web|3388	I'll try that
2017-08-02 23:30:41	manjaro-web|3388	which kernel do you recommend?
2017-08-02 23:30:52	thefallenrat	non rt kernel
2017-08-02 23:31:23	manjaro-web|3388	is there an LTS ?
2017-08-02 23:31:48	thefallenrat	linux49 is the latest lts

2017-08-02 23:32:37	thefallenrat	just to be sure, check what kernel do you have with this command : 
2017-08-02 23:32:40	thefallenrat	mhwd-kernel -li
2017-08-02 23:33:51	manjaro-web|3388	Currently running: 4.9.35-1-rt25-MANJARO (linux-rt-lts-manjaro)
2017-08-02 23:33:52	manjaro-web|3388	The following kernels are installed in your system:
2017-08-02 23:33:52	manjaro-web|3388	   * linux-rt-lts-manjaro
2017-08-02 23:34:16	thefallenrat	My guess are correct
2017-08-02 23:34:21	thefallenrat	you really are using rt kernel
2017-08-02 23:34:37	Redrield	I have a more general question
2017-08-02 23:34:40	thefallenrat	after you update your system and reboot run this command  : 
2017-08-02 23:34:42	Redrield	I want to get rid of windows
2017-08-02 23:34:55	thefallenrat	sudo mhwd-kernel -i linux49
2017-08-02 23:35:20	Redrield	But in order to get my computer to boot into grub, I had to use bcdedit to modify the boot manager path. Will getting rid of the windows parititon and the Microsoft entry from the EFI partition break that in a way where I wouldn't be able to boot?
2017-08-02 23:35:21	thefallenrat	reboot your system and when on grub choose linux 4.9 that are NOT RT
2017-08-02 23:36:09	manjaro-web|3388	Thanks @thefallenrat

2017-08-02 23:45:06	Aph3x-WL	unless it's booting in some way that depends on windows they should be completely separate
2017-08-02 23:47:10	Redrield	It'd be nice if that's the case, but I'm just being really cautious
2017-08-02 23:47:37	Redrield	I've killed a machine in the past when I got rid of windows, and the linux programs to modify the EFI boot order refused to save to disk

2017-08-02 23:48:41	Aph3x-WL	you can't change the boot order in the firmware?
2017-08-02 23:49:11	Redrield	My BIOS f2 menu just allows me to select boot order very coarsely
2017-08-02 23:49:40	Redrield	My options last I checked were "boot directly from bootmgfw.efi", and "boot from order determined by EFI on HDD", along with the obligatory usb, netboot etc
2017-08-02 23:50:02	Redrield	And efibootmgr couldn't change the boot order in a persistent manner
2017-08-02 23:50:08	Redrield	Only bcdedit on windows has done that for me
2017-08-02 23:50:21	Aph3x-WL	i mean the uefi firmware setup, not boot menu
2017-08-02 23:50:44	Aph3x-WL	there should be a button to push when your system boots up that takes you into firmware setup where you can change these things

2017-08-02 23:52:00	Aph3x-WL	are you sure you're using uefi? because it's either bios or uefi, not both o.O
2017-08-02 23:52:20	Redrield	It is uefi. /boot/efi is mounted
2017-08-02 23:52:25	Redrield	Not sure how else to describe it
2017-08-02 23:54:56	Aph3x-WL	well either way, if you decide to try it and it goes wrong, you should be able to easily fix it with a livecd

Reading https://forum.manjaro.org/t/installation-with-manjaro-architect-iso/20429/93 - it smells like the separation of a partition for efi and boot is novel to oberon/Manjaro, and hence why GRUB makes the fatal assumption that /boot/EFI must be capitalized, and not /boot/efi.

2017-08-03 01:22:50	manjaro-web|7063	Updating
2017-08-03 01:22:53	manjaro-web|8746	The answer to that question is "backups or disk snapshots"
2017-08-03 01:23:00	manjaro-web|7063	to 17.0.2
2017-08-03 01:24:00	manjaro-web|7063	None of that

2017-08-03 09:14:51	+Jolt2bolt	baradiel, that the will use as base archlinux and probably erase the problem that generate MHWD and some kind of other annoying stuff that manjaro added

2017-08-03 09:16:26	+Jolt2bolt	but that some interesting
2017-08-03 09:16:51	Invader_Bork	you can use it to make a manjaro flavor

2017-08-03 09:17:26	baradiel	if i format again , it will be my 5. time in this week :) and you are right i m angry with mhwd right now
2017-08-03 09:17:33	+Jolt2bolt	Invader_Bork, the problem about doing in that is the big add of packages you have to maintain...
2017-08-03 09:18:12	baradiel	lol i just fixed wine issue last night :) i would start at the beginning :)
2017-08-03 09:18:27	+Jolt2bolt	baradiel, you are not the only one. there is a ton of users that complained about the annoying that is MHWD and that they must erase that thing.

2017-08-04 00:13:15	manjarouser	i'm trying to install a package from AUR through pamac. it fails because inside the pkgbuild it has references to 4.12.3-1-ARCH instead of 4.12.3-1-1-MANJARO. this is not the first time i've run into this problem but this package depends on other packages with this same problem. am i doing something wrong? is this a common problem?

Now xorg seems to work again at least, however I still cannot use bumblebee, optirun error: "Could not load GPU driver"

2017-08-04 12:05:57	eschwartz	I'm not surprised a manjaro user would do that, but it still somehow disappoints me.
2017-08-04 12:06:04	roch_mjo	I am allowed to only run random commands from arch-wiki ? :)
2017-08-04 12:06:25	roch_mjo	this is desktop machine, I care not
2017-08-04 12:06:43	roch_mjo	and I learn in the process
2017-08-04 12:06:47	eschwartz	On the contrary, Arch has a strict policy about expecting people to know what the command does, rather than running it simply because they were told to by some wiki page

2017-08-04 12:07:20	morsus	eschwartz, how do you expect for us to learn if not by breaking it a few hundred times?
2017-08-04 12:07:30	roch_mjo	I will run them unknowingly in secret from now, ty. #tellNoOne
2017-08-04 12:07:42	roch_mjo	sory I am in a jolly mood ;)
2017-08-04 12:07:51	eschwartz	morsus: I obsessively read wikis and manpages
2017-08-04 12:08:13	morsus	hmm I read them too, but for noob its kinda hard to understand
2017-08-04 12:08:15	|	roch_mjo I shall resist from readong man.. I shall resist from readong man.. 
2017-08-04 12:08:37	morsus	you wont convince me that when you first started linux you typed all commands right
2017-08-04 12:08:50	eschwartz	roch_mjo: idk, whatever manjaro expects from people reading the manjaro wiki is probably fine for manjaro users
2017-08-04 12:08:52	roch_mjo	he was born with beard ;')
2017-08-04 12:09:24	morsus	well i wasnt so I am cursed to break a few systems before i learn :D
2017-08-04 12:09:25	roch_mjo	manjaro has a wiki ? wow
2017-08-04 12:09:44	eschwartz	Absolutely not, but "typed all commands right" is not the same as "knew what the command was supposed to do"
2017-08-04 12:09:49	morsus	also i think it was right here where someone said not to follow arch and manjaro wiki cause they are outdated
2017-08-04 12:10:00	roch_mjo	I also do not type , I paste :D
2017-08-04 12:10:06	morsus	lol :D
2017-08-04 12:10:16	eschwartz	roch_mjo: pretty sure manjaro has a wiki, but there isn't much on it ;)

2017-08-06 00:42:41	morsus	I will paste my question again just in case
2017-08-06 00:43:33	morsus	sorry for the flood
2017-08-06 00:43:34	morsus	hey guys i wanted to try out Plasma KDE but i already set up my xfce4 and i would like to return to it if i didnt like plasma, when instaling i got this message
2017-08-06 00:43:34	morsus	:: manjaro-kde-settings and manjaro-xfce-settings are in conflict (manjaro-desktop-settings). Remove manjaro-xfce-settings? [y/N] 
2017-08-06 00:43:34	morsus	would this make a problem if i did N?
2017-08-06 00:43:34	morsus	could I just save the xfce settings somewhere else and return it in case I get back to it?
2017-08-06 00:45:14	mr-jules	if you dont like kde
2017-08-06 00:45:17	mr-jules	dont replace 
2017-08-06 00:45:39	mr-jules	stay in xfce4 version of settings manager
2017-08-06 00:46:20	morsus	what exactly goes under de settings?
2017-08-06 00:46:31	morsus	pannels,icons,wallpapers what else?
2017-08-06 00:46:44	mr-jules	in my opinion, is not a good option to have gnome beside kde. or xfce beside kde. 
2017-08-06 00:47:02	mr-jules	different dependencies
2017-08-06 00:47:18	mr-jules	conflicts between qt and gtk
2017-08-06 00:48:20	morsus	hmm so there is no option to do this safely?
2017-08-06 00:50:19	mr-jules	in MY opinion mate. Nope. xfce - gnome - mate - lxde = gtk, no problem here. But kde or qt mixing gtk. it's a problem.
2017-08-06 00:51:07	morsus	hmm qt is?
2017-08-06 00:51:10	mr-jules	the first problem is the replacement of a important tool.
2017-08-06 00:51:11	morsus	im not really sure
2017-08-06 00:52:00	mr-jules	qt is the libreries and dependencies for GUI used in KDE.
2017-08-06 00:52:12	mr-jules	gtk for gnome/xfce
2017-08-06 00:52:25	morsus	i got qt installed on my xfce somehow
2017-08-06 00:52:46	morsus	lol
2017-08-06 00:52:58	mr-jules	you can try. hehe but it's not 100% secure
2017-08-06 00:53:06	mr-jules	Do it!
2017-08-06 00:53:10	mr-jules	hehe
2017-08-06 00:53:24	mr-jules	btw, you can try manjaro KDE
2017-08-06 00:53:37	morsus	haha, i probably will just need to understand what i am about to do
2017-08-06 00:53:56	morsus	are these settings stored in a file somwhere so i can back them up?

2017-08-06 01:06:02	Aph3x-WL	if something doesn't need it it doesn't use it, simple
2017-08-06 01:06:59	Aph3x-WL	that settings file conflict is just manjaro being....manjaro :/
2017-08-06 01:09:00	morsus	it wont let me continue unless i remove the settings for xfce
2017-08-06 01:09:07	morsus	i am now looking for a way to back it up
2017-08-06 01:09:33	morsus	but i still dont quite understand what exactly setting are there
2017-08-06 01:09:57	Aph3x-WL	i think the settings are for the custom environments manjaro uses
2017-08-06 01:10:22	Aph3x-WL	if you need it again you can always reinstall it
2017-08-06 01:10:36	morsus	yeah but i cant get a list of settings that are there actually
2017-08-06 01:10:46	morsus	does it have anything to do with apps i got installed?
2017-08-06 01:10:58	morsus	or its only icons/panels/wallpaper
2017-08-06 01:11:46	Aph3x-WL	i'm not sure, i assume it's only theme/layout/icons/etc
2017-08-06 01:12:01	morsus	meh the hell with it
2017-08-06 01:12:04	Aph3x-WL	if it affects your software then manjaro is even more poorly designed than i thought
2017-08-06 01:12:11	morsus	we will find out in a minute
2017-08-06 01:13:00	morsus	2.5gb? o.O
2017-08-06 01:13:19	morsus	this will be more than a minute
2017-08-06 01:13:41	Aph3x-WL	are you installing kde or plasma?
2017-08-06 01:13:45	Aph3x-WL	or both
2017-08-06 01:13:50	morsus	isnt that the same thing?
2017-08-06 01:13:54	morsus	KDE Plasma 5
2017-08-06 01:13:57	Aph3x-WL	kde i know if pretty big
2017-08-06 01:14:18	morsus	im kinda sitting on a branch im cutting here xD
2017-08-06 01:14:37	morsus	deleted the settings on a de i currently use
2017-08-06 01:14:37	Aph3x-WL	plasma is the DE, kde is the software for plasma
2017-08-06 01:14:57	Aph3x-WL	they used to be the samething but they for whatever reason decided to separate them
2017-08-06 01:15:11	morsus	damn 
2017-08-06 01:15:14	morsus	why so complicated
2017-08-06 01:15:35	Aph3x-WL	because boredom?
2017-08-06 01:15:37	 *	Aph3x-WL shrugs
2017-08-06 01:15:55	morsus	so there is now
2017-08-06 01:16:16	morsus	kernel->distro->de+software
2017-08-06 01:16:19	morsus	?
2017-08-06 01:16:58	Aph3x-WL	there's so much more than that :P
2017-08-06 01:17:06	morsus	yeah, i mean simplefied
2017-08-06 01:17:59	Aph3x-WL	i think most still bundle software with their DE
2017-08-06 01:18:05	morsus	i hope i dont break anythign again :/
2017-08-06 01:18:07	Aph3x-WL	kde/plasma is the only one i can think of that does that
2017-08-06 01:18:20	morsus	does what?
2017-08-06 01:18:22	Aph3x-WL	i prefer things simple so i don't use a DE :D
2017-08-06 01:18:34	Aph3x-WL	that separates software for the DE from the DE itself

2017-08-06 03:00:22	mike-zal	however legecy means there is some newer way of doing this so I guess it is safe to remove

2017-08-06 04:31:02	ajslye	anug, on what exacvtly?
2017-08-06 04:31:49	ajslye	wayland is just a protocol,
2017-08-06 04:31:53	anug	display freeze, irregular fonts, and black screen ajslye 
2017-08-06 04:32:17	ajslye	Gnome, KDE or Enlightenment?
2017-08-06 04:32:22	anug	but its faster than x11
2017-08-06 04:32:31	anug	KDE
2017-08-06 04:32:39	ajslye	these are the only DE that contain a wayland compositor

2017-08-06 05:23:55	CountryfiedLinux	good morning
2017-08-06 05:23:59	ajslye	anug, have you rebooted yet?
2017-08-06 05:24:13	ajslye	bus updates usually require a reboot.
2017-08-06 05:24:17	ajslye	dbus
2017-08-06 05:24:26	ajslye	sorry bout' that.
2017-08-06 05:24:41	anug	ajslye, its been since i install. also had the error in live session
2017-08-06 05:24:57	ajslye	huh
2017-08-06 05:25:30	anug	tried live in my friends system. the same error
2017-08-06 05:25:42	ajslye	the only other times I've seen dbus issues with the live image is if it was either the ISO was corrupt or written to a usb stick wrong.
2017-08-06 05:26:13	ajslye	aka used something like unetbooting with our iso.
2017-08-06 05:26:24	anug	i used suse image writer

2017-08-06 05:26:44	ajslye	ok then that is not it.
2017-08-06 05:26:55	CountryfiedLinux	One of the nice things about unetbootin is you can still use the usb for storage after writing the iso.
2017-08-06 05:26:58	anug	and also verified checksums
2017-08-06 05:27:13	ajslye	did you check the iso against the md5sum
2017-08-06 05:27:28	anug	ajslye, did
2017-08-06 05:27:41	ajslye	CountryfiedLinux, now, you know our ISO files don't work right with unetbooting.
2017-08-06 05:27:59	ajslye	is kio-extras installed?
2017-08-06 05:28:23	CountryfiedLinux	Making a bootable Windows usb is simpler though. Just mount ISO/OEM file and extract to the usb.
2017-08-06 05:28:44	anug	ajslye, installed
2017-08-06 05:29:08	ajslye	is this only with repoeditor?
2017-08-06 05:29:21	ajslye	that's an extra tool btw
2017-08-06 05:29:59	CountryfiedLinux	Raspberry Pi OSes are the same in that way actually. Not sure if mounting is required first though.
2017-08-06 05:30:03	CountryfiedLinux	bbl
2017-08-06 05:30:04	anug	ajslye, the same error with kde partition manager
2017-08-06 05:30:21	anug	the two i noticed since clean install
2017-08-06 05:30:33	ajslye	sounds more like anissue with dbus that kio
2017-08-06 05:31:23	ajslye	unless there is an issue with you HD
2017-08-06 05:31:45	anug	harddisk?
2017-08-06 05:31:54	ajslye	anug, what DE are you using?
2017-08-06 05:32:06	anug	ajslye, KDE plasma
2017-08-06 05:32:27	ajslye	huh, it's working perfectly on Netrunner Rolling
2017-08-06 05:32:58	ajslye	let me check some things and get right back to you.

2017-08-06 05:53:38	CountryfiedLinux	The Arch package management seems a bit chaotic. I don't think the package maintainers really work together to ensure their packages don't break other packages before pushing them out. Linux being so monolithic is one of the drawbacks.
2017-08-06 05:54:19	CountryfiedLinux	Seems more like "Get them out now and fix them later" rather than "If it ain't broke, don't break it".

2017-08-06 06:08:49	ajslye	CountryfiedLinux, to be fair part of the problem is also the KDE devs dropping support for launching applications via sudo..
2017-08-06 06:09:08	ajslye	QT is also following suit.
2017-08-06 06:10:44	ajslye	in other words, to gain admin privilege, the application need to ask for a password itself when needed.
2017-08-06 06:11:00	CountryfiedLinux	I think all packages should work well together before updates are pushed out, at least within the repository anyway.

2017-08-06 10:37:36	djb-irc	after u did a -Sy
2017-08-06 10:37:53	ajslye	pacman -Syu would be more accurate to apt update, look at the roseta I sent you the link to.

2017-08-06 14:44:07	ajslye	udisk2 does this.
2017-08-06 14:44:22	ajslye	I mean give it a mount point in your home directory for your use only..

2017-08-06 14:54:41	ajslye	unix121, did you try the virtualbox forums, etc.
2017-08-06 14:55:08	ajslye	virtualbox can be a royal PIA
2017-08-06 14:55:35	unix121	I'm too tired to spend the night trying to figure it out.
2017-08-06 14:55:55	unix121	I'll probably look it up tomorrow. Although VB has a good history of doing random things for me.
2017-08-06 14:56:20	ajslye	is linux the client or the host?
2017-08-06 14:56:57	unix121	Both, the host is Manjaro the client is Debian
2017-08-06 14:57:40	ajslye	do you have the host and client modules installed?
2017-08-06 14:57:42	unix121	Although I just noticed that it only happens on the i3 Debian version. The Gnome version can stay maximized normally.
2017-08-06 14:57:52	unix121	Yeah , everything is installed normally.
2017-08-06 14:58:14	unix121	It probably has something to do with my configuration inside the Virtual Machine.
2017-08-06 14:58:41	ajslye	even virtualbox-guest-iso and virtualbox-guest-utils?
2017-08-06 14:59:06	ajslye	gnome uses a compositing WM i3 typically doesn't
2017-08-06 14:59:13	unix121	Yeap. 
2017-08-06 14:59:14	ajslye	this seems backwards to me.
2017-08-06 14:59:20	unix121	Well whatever, I'm not gonna bother with it anyways.
2017-08-06 14:59:28	ajslye	that's cool.
2017-08-06 14:59:30	unix121	I had a weird bug in i3 as well.
2017-08-06 14:59:43	ajslye	just that compositors usually cause these kinds of issues.
2017-08-06 14:59:56	unix121	Fullscreening a VM would show the host until I reboot the monitor :P 
2017-08-06 14:59:58	ajslye	with VBox anyway,

2017-08-07 00:21:03	Aph3x-WL	M_aD: so the issue is that he asked if something he heard was true and didn't tell you where he heard it from? o.O

2017-08-07 00:27:45	SohamG	Hey everyone, Is it possible to install an Arch linux package in manjaro?
2017-08-07 00:28:13	thefallenrat	possible
2017-08-07 00:28:18	thefallenrat	But do it at your own risk
2017-08-07 00:28:42	SohamG	How do I do it?
2017-08-07 00:30:36	thefallenrat	The fact that you don't know how to put repo in pacman.conf means that I can't trust your responsibility with it
2017-08-07 00:30:43	thefallenrat	just tell me what do you want to install?
2017-08-07 00:30:52	thefallenrat	seems likely there's one available in AUR
2017-08-07 00:31:24	ringo	which arch-linux package ?
2017-08-07 00:32:20	SohamG	Well I'm having a problem with steam where it disconnects the internet everytime I launch it. I didnt find a mention of this on the arch wiki so thought the arch version might not have this issue
2017-08-07 00:32:35	SohamG	pacman -S steam installs "steam-manjaro"
2017-08-07 00:33:42	thefallenrat	You sure it was steam that causing this? And not your network card?
2017-08-07 00:34:05	SohamG	Nope, works fine on win10 and on antergos which I used a while back
2017-08-07 00:34:40	ringo	from archlinux.org
2017-08-07 00:34:44	ringo	you can download it also
2017-08-07 00:34:51	ringo	then pacman -U (package)
2017-08-07 00:35:08	ringo	SohamG,  if you do pacman -Ss steam
2017-08-07 00:35:16	ringo	you see more then steam-manjaro
2017-08-07 00:35:16	SohamG	yea I downloaded the .tar.gz file and did pacman -U but it says invalid package architecture
2017-08-07 00:35:30	ringo	pkg.tar.gz
2017-08-07 00:35:34	ringo	that structure
2017-08-07 00:35:54	ringo	pkg.tar.xz
2017-08-07 00:35:55	SohamG	yea the .pkg.tar.gz file
2017-08-07 00:35:57	ringo	this
2017-08-07 00:36:05	SohamG	Ill try steam-native
