2017-07-23 14:23:52	Hund	It is. :)
2017-07-23 14:24:54	mr-jules	The windowmaker launcher is too ugly, and looks so old haha.
2017-07-23 14:25:10	mr-jules	Like 'Run...' from windows.
2017-07-23 14:25:19	Hund	haha

2017-07-23 14:34:55	mr-jules	Cool, ruby.
2017-07-23 14:35:30	mr-jules	Ruby vs Python.
2017-07-23 14:37:06	Hund	:)
2017-07-23 14:37:15	Hund	Python is nice for some things.
2017-07-23 14:37:24	Hund	But it tends to eat a lot of RAM.
2017-07-23 14:37:43	mr-jules	Exactly. Rainbowstream is a good example.
2017-07-23 14:38:00	Hund	t has been running for a day or two and it's currrntly at 33MB RAM for me.
2017-07-23 14:39:26	mr-jules	I put 't' and not running :P

2017-07-23 15:30:40	Hund	ah :D
2017-07-23 15:38:59	Hund	I'm practising typing. :P
2017-07-23 16:05:24	Hund	I never learn to type with all my 10 fingers, as a kid I didn't even know it was a thing. And about 5 weeks ago, I deicided to give it a shot.
2017-07-23 16:06:13	Hund	I used to touch type with like 2,5 fingers.
2017-07-23 16:06:25	Hund	The first day with 10 fingers I got like 5WPM.
2017-07-23 16:06:33	Hund	Today I got 85WPM.

2017-07-23 17:20:32	Hund	Same case but with only clear layers.
2017-07-23 17:21:05	Hund	What do you have now?
2017-07-23 17:21:12	Hund	And what do you want?
2017-07-23 17:32:47	mr-jules	I have one generic for my desktop. Logitech
2017-07-23 17:32:58	mr-jules	I need hard keys.
2017-07-23 17:33:06	Hund	Ah. :D
2017-07-23 17:33:54	Hund	The Let's split is a fairly cheap keyboard.
2017-07-23 17:34:15	Hund	If you know how to solder.
2017-07-23 17:34:41	mr-jules	Cool!! Split !!
2017-07-23 17:34:50	mr-jules	I don't see that
2017-07-23 17:34:54	mr-jules	Before
2017-07-23 17:35:04	Hund	Ah :P
2017-07-23 17:35:13	Hund	Mr Blind.
2017-07-23 17:35:16	Hund	;)
2017-07-23 17:35:41	Hund	It's the same size as the Planck.
2017-07-23 17:36:02	Hund	Did you notice it's ortholinear then?
2017-07-23 17:37:07	mr-jules	With the enter, at center? 
2017-07-23 17:37:35	Hund	https://mpilquist.github.io/planck/complete.jpg
2017-07-23 17:37:41	Hund	That's a Planck.
2017-07-23 17:37:42	mr-jules	And exactly key split.
2017-07-23 17:37:59	Hund	Noticing any different from a regular keyboard? :P
2017-07-23 17:38:12	mr-jules	Yes haha.
2017-07-23 17:38:19	Hund	:D
2017-07-23 17:38:23	mr-jules	It's more confortable?
2017-07-23 17:38:41	Hund	I hope so. :D
2017-07-23 17:38:43	Hund	Haha
2017-07-23 17:38:56	Hund	It's my first ortholinear keyboard.
2017-07-23 17:42:38	mr-jules	Feels weird or something?
2017-07-23 17:43:32	Hund	As I said, I'm hoping to get it the next day. :P
2017-07-23 17:44:37	Hund	I'm crazy nervous for building it though. I have never soldered anything live before. Just some light practicing.
2017-07-23 17:52:31	mr-jules	Yes. You need to practice, you need to be a cirujan :P
2017-07-23 17:52:49	Hund	A what? :P
2017-07-23 17:53:36	mr-jules	Surgery doctor or something haha
2017-07-23 17:53:42	mr-jules	My english is deplorable
2017-07-23 17:53:44	mr-jules	Hehe
2017-07-23 17:53:54	Hund	:D
2017-07-23 17:56:19	Hund	If you're looking to buy a new keyboard, I'll be more than willing to help you.
2017-07-23 17:56:45	Hund	I know a lot of keyboards. :P
2017-07-23 18:05:20	mr-jules	A good shop?
2017-07-23 18:05:31	mr-jules	With international ship :p
2017-07-23 18:06:25	Hund	Depends on what you want.
2017-07-23 18:06:39	Hund	OEM or custom?
2017-07-23 18:06:47	Hund	Or DIY?
2017-07-23 18:06:56	Hund	Size?
2017-07-23 18:07:00	Hund	Switches?
2017-07-23 18:07:15	Hund	Programmability?
2017-07-23 18:07:21	Hund	Lights?
2017-07-23 18:07:26	Hund	:D
2017-07-23 18:39:54	mr-jules	I want big keys
2017-07-23 18:39:58	mr-jules	No lights
2017-07-23 18:40:02	mr-jules	Programable
2017-07-23 20:22:55	Hund	Big keys?
2017-07-23 20:23:12	Hund	What do you mean with big keys?
2017-07-23 20:32:25	Hund	There two types of programmable keyboards. I call them semi- and fully programmable. The Pok3r is a semi, it let's you program a few secondary layers 'on the fly', by entering some programming mode. You can rebind like h to be right arrow and you can have some macros as well. You can then switch to those layera with predefined shortcuts. It's not super advanced, but it's enough for some.
2017-07-23 20:32:28	Hund	And we have what I like to call fully programmable keyboards. That's when you create a layout via software on the computer. You can change everything however you want it. You can chance the primary layer as well and there's no limitations what so ever. And you can make keys have several functions, for example, when you press and hold the space key it activates layer X and when you release it without further
2017-07-23 20:32:30	Hund	action, is works just like a regular space key.
2017-07-23 20:32:32	Hund	You then create a file with your layout which you flash the microcontroller with, replacing the default firmware with your version.
2017-07-23 20:34:31	Hund	But if you want that level of programmability, you need to go down the custom keyboard route.
2017-07-23 20:38:19	Hund	If you don't can or want to solder, you can find people who build them for you.
2017-07-23 20:38:22	Hund	1UP Keyboards will build whatever you send to him. He wants $40-50 for it. The downside is waiting time and cost for sending it back and forth to the US.
2017-07-23 20:38:26	Hund	But there are others who sells premade kits. I can't think of one right now, but I can see what's out there.
2017-07-25 23:16:06	Hund	yo
2017-07-25 23:24:38	mr-jules	Hello ma friend !

2017-07-25 23:32:51	Hund	:D
2017-07-25 23:33:07	mr-jules	Are you right :D
2017-07-25 23:34:17	Hund	I'm not much for hot places. :P
2017-07-25 23:35:17	mr-jules	You live in the forest, cold forest. A hot place is innaceptable :P i understand
2017-07-25 23:36:03	Hund	I like it when it's around 15-20°C (59-68°F). :D
2017-07-25 23:38:04	mr-jules	Where i live (Los cabos, bcs). in summer, its around... 30° - 35° 
2017-07-25 23:38:40	Hund	That's not too bad I guess.
2017-07-25 23:38:49	Hund	I guess you have a lower humidity as well.
2017-07-25 23:38:54	Hund	If it'
2017-07-25 23:39:17	Hund	If it's 35°C here, you'll want to hide in the freezer.
2017-07-25 23:39:37	mr-jules	If you live beside the beach. Humidity is the all day bread.
2017-07-25 23:39:56	Hund	Okey. :)
2017-07-25 23:40:25	Hund	Or is it high humidity that's preferable in hot climates?
2017-07-25 23:40:30	Hund	I got unsure now. :P
2017-07-25 23:41:50	mr-jules	Nope. high humidity is a soffocant sensation when the termometer is around 33° ... 
2017-07-25 23:41:59	Hund	Ah
2017-07-25 23:41:59	mr-jules	I think haha
2017-07-25 23:42:00	Hund	:D
2017-07-25 23:42:03	Hund	haha

2017-07-25 23:45:59	Hund	Okey. :)
2017-07-25 23:46:28	mr-jules	But.. only paradisiac in the beach. NOT the city :)
2017-07-25 23:46:34	Hund	Ah :D
2017-07-25 23:47:04	mr-jules	The city is a self-urbanized city.
2017-07-25 23:47:20	mr-jules	I dont like so much these part
2017-07-25 23:47:31	Hund	Oh, I see. :)

2017-07-25 23:48:36	Hund	But I must confess that the Norwegian fjords is enchanting.
2017-07-25 23:48:52	mr-jules	It's like Skyrim? :) haha.

2017-07-26 22:56:35	Hund	Nice! :D
2017-07-26 22:57:29	Hund	I'm trying ro flash my Pro Micro now so I know it works before soldering it on.
2017-07-26 22:57:48	Hund	It's always nervous hacking with hardware when you're new to it. :P
2017-07-26 23:18:54	Hund	-wh
2017-07-26 23:19:00	Hund	-with
2017-07-26 23:37:59	mr-jules	Bag and breakfast ready.
2017-07-26 23:38:04	mr-jules	Hardware is not for me.
2017-07-26 23:38:07	Hund	:D
2017-07-26 23:38:13	mr-jules	:(
2017-07-26 23:38:19	Hund	It wasnt hard flashing it. :)
2017-07-26 23:38:34	mr-jules	Only changed a memory ram, and gpu in all my life
2017-07-26 23:38:50	mr-jules	no keyboards. mouses or somethin
2017-07-26 23:38:51	mr-jules	:(
2017-07-26 23:38:57	Hund	Ah. :)
2017-07-26 23:39:02	Hund	It's not hard. :)
2017-07-26 23:49:46	mr-jules	But an error its a high-cost. haha
2017-07-26 23:49:57	Hund	Not really.
2017-07-26 23:51:15	Hund	The Let's split PCBs costs $20.
2017-07-26 23:51:20	Hund	It's not that bad.
2017-07-26 23:52:32	Hund	The micro controllers is $9 and oyu need two for the Let's split.
2017-07-26 23:52:52	Hund	So if you damge them when you solder, it's not the end of the world.
2017-07-26 23:54:15	Hund	If you're building a 60-80% keyboard, then the PCBs is more at $40-60. But on those you don't need to solder the micro controllers on.
2017-07-26 23:54:31	Hund	Just the switches and that's a piece of cake if you know basic soldering.
2017-07-26 23:59:19	mr-jules	Haha yep. i think. soldering isn's hard. But, for example. if you put incorrectly one fin from a cpu, $120 to the trash.
2017-07-27 00:01:17	Hund	You cant'
2017-07-27 00:01:25	Hund	You can't place the CPU wrong. :)
2017-07-27 00:10:42	mr-jules	Hahahaha yes ! but it's a example
2017-07-27 00:11:06	mr-jules	The cpu socket designed for dummies haha.
2017-07-27 00:11:12	Hund	haha
2017-07-29 08:27:10	Hund	yo
2017-07-29 08:27:36	Hund	I saw your screenshot the other day.
2017-07-29 08:29:37	Hund	It had a window with my conversation. That's a big slap on your hands you man! :) I take privacy very serious, both for my self and for others. If you want to show my conversation to anyone, I'd appreciate if you would ask next time. :)
2017-08-02 13:55:53	Hund	http://hundone.deviantart.com/art/My-Desktop-August-2017-696394373
2017-08-02 16:58:21	mr-jules	Finally! A new screenshoot. hehe. You may to check: herbsflutwm. I'm using it now, in my opinion is better than i3.

2017-08-07 09:10:12	Hund	yo
