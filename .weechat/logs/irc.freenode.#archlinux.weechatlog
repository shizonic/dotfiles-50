2017-07-23 18:18:03	sypher	That's not really a clear answer. You don't need GRE for site to site, and if you want a road-warrior style VPN setup, L2TP/IPsec sucks.
2017-07-23 18:18:12	sypher	Use OpenVPN and call it a day.

2017-07-23 19:00:01	nlogex	vpn is too heavy, I don't want to tunnel my entire phone's connection just to connect back to a service at home, I was thinking something like a web portal
2017-07-23 19:00:17	sypher	You don't have to tunnel your phone's entire connection.
2017-07-23 19:00:39	sypher	That's point #1. Point #2: a VPN is too heavy, but a WEB PORTAL isn't?
2017-07-23 19:00:40	sheep	you can set openvpn to only handle certain routes iirc
2017-07-23 19:00:51	sypher	That's its default mode.
2017-07-23 19:00:54	sheep	a web portal is going to be heavier than openvpn
2017-07-23 19:01:04	sypher	It only tunnels the whole connection if you add a gateway redirect.
2017-07-23 19:01:21	nlogex	oh ok, good to know
2017-07-23 19:01:28	nlogex	I will look into then

2017-07-23 19:03:44	sypher	L2TP/IPsec is a huge pain in the gonads, to be frank. OpenVPN is a lot easier to work with.

Why isn't pacaur installing everything?

2017-07-24 22:21:13	eschwartz	oh duh... backlogs exist to give context :D
2017-07-24 22:21:30	eschwartz	amdgpu-pro, how sad.
2017-07-24 22:21:36	AltReality	I'm trying to run pacman -Syu, and getting an error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files) - ca-certificates-utils: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt exists in filesystem.
2017-07-24 22:21:40	ywecur[m]	What do you guys think? All I'm trying to do is get ethminer to work, and currently it doesn't recognize any card. The developer has said that amdgpu pro is required
2017-07-24 22:21:45	AltReality	Any ideas where I can look to fix it?
2017-07-24 22:21:52	sheep	AltReality: when was the last time you did a full update?
2017-07-24 22:21:55	eschwartz	you could rebuild xorg i you like, I think someone even had a repo at one point.
